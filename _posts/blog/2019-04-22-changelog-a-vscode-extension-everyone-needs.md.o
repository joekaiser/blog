**Problem:** How can I quickly and seamlessly see if an NPM package is out of date, and view the changelog? Bonus points if I don't need to leave my IDE.

**Answer:** [Changelog by Jacob Cofman](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=JacobCofman.changelog)

Changelog is one of those rare extensions that does one thing really well. If you hover your mouse over the version of a dependency in your package.json a nice popup opens with release information.

The extension tries to fetch the `CHANGELOG.md` file from the packages repository so it won't work with _every_ package, but it will still let you know if there is a new version. That is a win in my book. ðŸ™Œ

I know it sounds silly, but being able to look this up without context switching is kind of a big deal. I'm always looking for tools to fit into my workflow, and this one does it perfectly.  Give it a try.
