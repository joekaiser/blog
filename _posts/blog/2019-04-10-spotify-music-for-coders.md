Do you want to know how to irritate software engineers? Break their focus. Much of what we do is problem solving. Sometimes they are simple, but often then don't have an obvious solution.

>We need to make sure we don't show duplicate records in the list

OK, I'll change the query to remove them. 
Oh, that isn't right. The admin page needs all records and it shares this function.
I don't want to duplicate this code, so lets filter these out upstream
Oh, now we are only showing 9 records instead of the default page size of 10.

Perhaps that isn't the best scenario but it get's my point across. If we aren't able to focus on the problem at hand then solving it is harder than it should be.

I work in an open-office environment. There are only 4 of us in the room, but it can still be distracting. Someone is on a call. These two are catching up. Did he say my name?

I have tried every "focus" Spotify playlist that recommended to me but come on. They are piano or guitar, classical or lo-fi.  These are going to put me to sleep. ðŸ˜´  

I wanted something up-beat but not too crazy and no lyrics to distract me. Enter the generically named [Music for coding](https://open.spotify.com/user/jdkaiser/playlist/2Uh4sdLSVfCz79j9RWfHcN?si=LSSXROnyR7OObnSeWibVHw)
