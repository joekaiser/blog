Do you want to know how to irritate software engineers? Break their focus. Much of what we do is problem-solving. Sometimes they are simple, but often they don't have an obvious solution.

>We need to make sure we don't show duplicate records in the list

*OK, I'll change the query to remove them*
 
*Oh, that isn't right. The admin page needs all records and it shares this function*
 
*I don't want to duplicate this code; let's filter these out upstream*
 
*Oh, now we are only showing 9 records instead of the default page size of 10*

Perhaps that isn't the best scenario but it gets my point across. If we aren't able to focus on the problem at hand then solving it is harder than it should be.

I work in an open-office environment. There are only 4 of us in the room, but it can still be distracting. Someone is on a call. These two are catching up. Did he say my name?
 Downing out the noise is imperative.

I have tried every "focus" playlist Spotify recommended to me, but they are so slow and peaceful - I could fall asleep listening to them ðŸ˜´. I wanted something upbeat, not too crazy, and no lyrics to distract me. Enter the creatively named [Music for Coding](https://open.spotify.com/user/jdkaiser/playlist/2Uh4sdLSVfCz79j9RWfHcN?si=LSSXROnyR7OObnSeWibVHw). 3 hours of music to drown out the noise when you need it the most.

I have been using it for a few months, and it hasn't let me down yet. If you are in the mood for something new and different then give it a try. 

Enough distraction - back to that problem!
