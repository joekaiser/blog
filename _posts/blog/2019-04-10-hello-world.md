Hi, [I'm Joe](/about)

I have been Internet-MIA, but I'm back, refreshed, and have been kicking around the idea of a blog for a while now. It finally feels like the right time to do it.

The purpose of this blog is like most others, I suppose. I'm going to:

- document the things I learn
- share insights I have
- help aspiring software engineers succeed

If I can do one of those three things then this will be a success.

You can follow me over on [github (joekaiser)](https://github.com/joekaiser) [gitlab (joekaiser)](https://gitlab.com/joekaiser) or [twitter (@Jotato)](https://twitter.com/jotato)

I'll see you around
