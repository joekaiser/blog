I am what some people call a self sufficient “full stack developer”. I know my way around data modeling, database tuning, scale-able architecture, front end code, service design, and performance. I enjoy solving problems and mentoring young engineers. 

I live in Seattle and currently work for [Drift](https://www.drift.com) building out the [Siftrock](https://www.siftrock.com) product. 

My passion is building software, but when I am not doing that you can find me:

* Working on DIY projects with my wife
* Making my kids groan with "dad jokes"
* Building furniture in my wood shop (aka: the garage)
