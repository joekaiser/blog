Newsletters have been fascinating me lately. I'm not sure I understand why, but something about them feels more personal. 

This newsletter is only for fun. I'm not going to sell your email address, or try to get you to buy something from me. I just want to experiment and see what happens. I don't expect to send many of them out. Probably just a few times a year.

If you are interested then sign up at <https://volleyy.com/changelog/>. You can unsubscribe at anytime, of course.
